# Maze Runner
## A school project almost fully in python (if possible, wasm packages can be used for optimisations)

It uses graphs algorithms for path searching (A*)

Basically, this is a 2.5D game where you spawn in a maze, and escape monster that track and move towards you in the maze.

This game uses raycasting to view the world in first perspective and A* algorithm for finding the best path
to the player. 

The maps are premade using Tiled, using premade public assets for public use

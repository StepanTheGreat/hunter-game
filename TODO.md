## Plan
1. Create a basic game plan
2. Priority for systems (systems get sorted at the end, based on their priority)
3. Sprite text rendering (text that will be rendered similar to sprites) 
4. Basic scene support (main menu, ingame, ...) 
5. Model a simple UDP network protocol, that would feature reliability, data integrity checks and dublicate avoidance.
6. Add a basic multiplayer support (no anticheat for now)
7. Add lighting to the game
...
10. Find assets like music, sounds, textures and fonts for the game. Learn more about license merging

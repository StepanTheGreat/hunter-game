# Done!

## Modularize the thing, so that it's actually usable and extensible. 
You could use a plugin-like system like in ECS frameworks. Systems *could also* be a great way of abstracting
functionality.

## Plan
1. Create a basic game plan
3. Priority for systems (systems get sorted at the end, based on their priority)
4. Sprite UV coordinates (an ability to render specific texture regions for sprites) using UV matrices
5. Sprite text rendering (text that will be rendered similar to sprites) 
6. Proper collision detection (for rectangles and circles) USE A MANUAL IMPLEMENTATION!
7. Basic scene support (main menu, ingame, ...) 
8. Model a simple UDP network protocol, that would feature reliability, data integrity checks and dublicate avoidance.
9. Add a simple encryption to the traffic using public/private keys.
10. Add a basic multiplayer support (no anticheat for now)
11. Add lighting to the game
...
20. Find assets like music, sounds, textures and fonts for the game. Learn more about license merging
